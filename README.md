### About

This tutorial teaches you how to create C++ software that performs Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. It was written primarily to help students in my laboratory to develop software that they can later modify for their own purposes, but I hope it is more broadly useful.

This is the third version of the tutorial. It differs from the second version in the order in which features are added and in allowing data partitioning. 

**This web site is currently a work in progress. This notice will disappear once it is ready to be used.**{: style="color: red"}.

### Author

The tutorial was written by [Paul O. Lewis](http://phylogeny.uconn.edu).

### Funding
This tutorial was developed as a broader impact project associated with National Science Foundation grant DEB-1354146 (Estimating the Bayesian phylogenetic information content of systematic data, PI Paul O. Lewis).

### Licence
The software that you will create falls under the permissive open-source [MIT License](license.html).
